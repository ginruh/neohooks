> Debug and test webhooks at ease

### Introduction

Neohooks provides you a playground for webhook debugging and testing without a hassle. It provides unique and random URLs which can be used to debug and test webhooks and HTTP requests.

Neohooks is inspired by [webhook.site](https://webhook.site). It is more focused on self hosting though you can use the [live version](https://neohooks.site).

### Todos

- [ ] Add error handling for every API endpoint on UI
- [ ] Add unit tests on UI and API
- [ ] Write a CLI client which can talk to API
- [ ] Add integration tests

I haven't added features in todos. Please file an issue, if a feature is required that you consider essential.
